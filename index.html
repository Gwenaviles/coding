          The victim, Cynthia Trevillion, was walking with her husband towards the Morse Red Line CTA station when “suspects in a dark vehicle drove by and fired shots,” said Officer Sweeney of the Chicago Police News Affairs Department. Trevillion, a math teacher at the Chicago Waldorf School in Rogers Park, was shot in the head and transported to Presence St. Francis Hospital in Evanston where she was pronounced dead. There are currently no suspects being held in custody for the shooting.</p>

          William Campbell, 23, was working at Dunkin’ Donuts near the scene when he heard the gunfire. “A bunch of people were here when the shots were fired. Everyone was ducking on the floor. Chairs were flying,” Campbell said.

          Across the street at Cameo Cleaners, Sunny Park, 62, also heard the gun shots and dashed for cover under her sewing table. Park, who has been working at the cleaners for the last six years, says this is the second shooting she’s heard. “When I first started working here in Rogers Park, the neighborhood was still bad,” she said, in reference to the amount of violent crimes in the area. “But the neighborhood has been getting good, especially since the Morse station was renovated and new businesses have been moving in.”

          According to the Chicago Tribune’s “Crime in Chicagoland” report, Rogers Park ranks 45th among Chicago’s 77 community areas.

          “Rogers Park is a great neighborhood. I’ve lived here nine years and I wouldn’t live anywhere else,” said Wally Andersen, 35, manager of Rogers Park Social, a bar located next to the shooting scene. “We’re all local people who work here and live here so it’s a really trying time for people.”

          Members of the Rogers Park community will gather tonight at 8 p.m. for a fundraiser in a display of financial and emotional support for Trevillion’s relatives and friends. “It’s devastating for our community. When something like this happens, it throws everyone in a spin,” said Andersen.
